# Collective detection based on visual information in animal groups

This project was based on the paper of Jacob D. Davidson et al., where the team investigated how is individual and collective visual detection dependant on various parameters ie. the number of individuals in a group, the state of the group, the position of the individual within the group etc. The goal of this project was to study and replicate the results that the team achieved using synthetic data and collect the same metrics, but also to implement a simple predator avoidance algorithm to observe how individual and collective visual information change with respect to the predator movement.
Unfortunatly we weren't able to implement the predator algorithm.

## Run the simulation
1. Download the Source code 'CollectiveBehaviour-main'
2. Download the file 'saved_data_and_results.zip' from the Source data link
3. Unzip the 'saved_data_and_results.zip' and put the 'savedresults-final' folder on the same folder that the 'CollectiveBehaviour-main' is located. Otherwise the directory should be changed inside the code
4. Only the files '4 - Data figures.ipynb' and '5 - Model.ipynb' are used to produce the results

Software used: VS Code, Anaconda3, Python 3.9.7
